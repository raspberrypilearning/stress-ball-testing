Try to find a different sound that works well.

Change the size that your stress ball shrinks and grows to.

Try the `fisheye`{:class="block3looks"} effect instead of `whirl`{:class="block3looks"}. You could also find out what happens if you choose negative numbers.

Use what you have learned to add more stress toys to your project. You do not have to start from the **Ball** sprite. Add a different sprite to your project and see what happens when you add graphic effects to it.
